    <h1>College Life</h1>

    <p>
        College life is a new experience for many students. It teaches responsibility
        and time management skills. Students attend classes and complete assignments
        regularly. These experiences help prepare students for the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        College is also a place to meet new people. Students often work together on
        group projects. Many students join clubs or organizations on campus.
        These activities help students grow personally and socially.
