    <h1>College Life</h1>

    <p>
        College life is a new experience for many students. It teaches responsibility and time
        management skills. Students attend classes and complete assignments regularly.
        College is also a place to meet new people. Students often work together on group projects,
        and many join clubs or organizations on campus. These experiences help students grow
        personally and socially.
